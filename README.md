# flickrtoexif
Tagged, Geotagged and given many pictures a title in Flickr? Want to copy that metadata to your local image files so that Picasa (or another photo management tool) can also benefit? This script should do the trick!

This script takes as an argument a bunch of images. It then tries to find these same images on your Flickr account based on "DateTimeOriginal". If it finds one match (and only one match) it will copy title, tags and geolocation to the local exif data.
